    <h1>Welcome To <strong><em>Word Eruption 2!</em></strong></h1>
    <!-- Going to pull 'Tu me Manques from official blog' -->
    <p>This site is still under construction but for now, enjoy!<br/>
        Main site: <strong><em>https://lovejamm.wixsite.com/erupt/post/tu-me-manques</em></strong></p>
    <p><em>Tu me manques (You are missing from me, also, I miss you) tells the tale of a forlorn young adult who yearns for nothing but to see - or hear from the love of his life at least once more.</em></p>
    <h2><strong>Tu Me Manques</strong></h2>
    <p>I don’t really remember the last time I cried,<br/>
        But I’m beginning to feel tears well up in my eyes.<br/>  
        Perhaps it’s Johann Pachelbel’s Canon in D composition, <br/>
        Or perhaps, it’s the fact that your pictures are not enough substitutes of you for me. <br/>
        I really can’t say how many times I’ve picked up my phone, <br/>
        Hoping to have woken up to a text or a missed call. <br/>
        It stings a bit to not know if you’re okay, <br/>
        Or if you were not able to manage a smile today. <br/>
        My mind creates all possible scenarios, <br/>
        Of what you could be going through all the way there <br/>
        - and it’s crazy.<br/>
        Perhaps, I’m too sane to do anything rash, <br/>
        Or maybe I’m just too scared to check up on you on the other side of the country.
     </p>
     <p>
        In my head, we have lengthy convos; <br/>
        Half what we’ve talked about <br/>
        And half what my brain is constructing. <br/>
        I smile at nostalgic the memories <br/>
        And crazy things we both did spontaneously,<br/> 
        Kinda like a middle schooler, head-over-heels for someone.<br/>
        <strong><em> The point is, I miss you</em></strong><br/>
        - So much it’s beginning to hurt.<br/>
        Yeah, I know I cannot see you in person<br/> 
        - At least, not now; <br/>
        But is it too much to ask to hear your voice? <br/>
     </p>
     <p>
        I’m guessing it’s probably not your fault things are this way, <br/>
        And I feel you’re probably having as much of a rotten time as I am, if not more. <br/>
        I really do hope you’re doing very well <br/>
        And we can resolve all this as very quickly <br/>
        Just so I get to hear your voice soon <br/>
        - Well, that’s if, I can’t get to see you.<br/>
